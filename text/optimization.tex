\subsection{Partition Method Selection}

\subsection{Dominating Region in Grid-based Partitions}
Does not consider balanced partition.
Dominating region is not identical across partition.

\subsection{Dominating Region in Angle-based Partitions}
filter out objects that in the Angle-based partition

\subsection{Filter Method Selection}

Our methods:
1. Difficulty in Filtering point selection.
un-balanced among partition.  


2. Difficulty in dynamic update of filtering points.



select at least one point per partition.
